# NHS_privatisation_treatments
This is a repository of underlying data and code to reproduce the analysis of increasing privatisation provided in the forthcoming paper soon to be published in the journal of Health Policy: "'Accident and Emergency’? Exploring the reasons for increased privatisation in England’s NHS". 

The data is taken from NHS England's 'referral to treatment time' releases - have a look: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/
